NFS:- Network File Service
    - used to share files
    - also needs rpc-bind and mountd to work with nfs

    


Control services

systemctl status service_name
systemctl start service_name
systemctl stop service_name
systemctl restart service_name
systemctl enable service_name
systemctl disable service_name

LAB
server=192.168.1.1
client=192.168.1.2

On server
Create /tmp/data
$mkdir /tmp/data
$touch /tmp/data/t1.txt

To set permission
$chmod -R 777 /tmp/data

To check nfs service status
$systemctl status nfs

To start service
$sudo systemctl start nfs

To share /tmp/data with world we must put entry in /etc/exports
$sudo vi /etc/exports
/tmp/data *(rw,sync)
save and exit

To restart nfs
$sudo systemctl restart nfs

To add rules in firewall, to allow traffic from client
GUI method
Application>sundry>firewall
    configuration:permanent
     from services check for
                         nfs
                         mountd
                         rpc-bind
  options> reload firewall

To check What files/dir are being exported by this system
$sudo exportfs
>> must show entries from exportfs file

On Client system

$ping 192.168.1.1

$showmount -e 192.168.1.1
>> showing export list from server

To access them we need to mount
$cd Desktop 
$mkdir nfsdata

to mount /tmp/data which is on server to nfsdata
$sudo mount 192.168.1.1:/tmp/data nfsdata

Using mouse open nfsdata directory
try to access and make changes in t1.txt

create t2.txt

Go to server
verify if changes made by client are there
