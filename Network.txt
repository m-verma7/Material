What is Network ??
>> Connecting 2 or more things to each  other
  

Usage / Why Network ??
- Share data/ services
- Resource sharing
- Manage multiple device 
- E-commerce
- Communication

Types of Network ?
>> how much area is covered
PAN
LAN
CAN
MAN
WAN


Requirements to set up network ??
Hardware:-
    1. LAN card/NIC/Ethernet (as per media selection)
    2. Cables/Connectors
    3. Internetworking Device 


Software:
   1. O.S. :- Device drivers always O.S. Specific
   2. File and print permission
   3. Protocol
 
   
How to setup Network ??
Access each device
Enable file/print service
Define and access Protocol

What is Protocol?
 >> Set of rules and regulations
   IP (Internet protocol)
   DNS (Domain name service/system)
   DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
   SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
   SMTP (Simple Mail transfer protocol)
   IMAP
   POP
   FTP
   NFS
   SAMBA  etc..
 
 
Understanding how network works 
   Conceptual Model of ISO/OSI layer
   - To work on all networking device exactly same way
   - 
7 Layers


7. Application(data)
6. Presentation(data)
5. Session(data)
4. Transmission(Segments)

3. Network(Packets):- Logical Addressing, Packets, Routing and packet 		      exchange, NW controller

2. DLL(frames):- Synchronization, ECC, Physical addressing,Framing
      Physical Address:-  Permanent Address of any LAN card
                         - MAC (media Access Control) add
                         - World wide unique
                         - manufacturers assign it
                         - 48 bits written in hexadecimal no. system


             
1. Physical(bit):- Making/breaking connections, defining data rate, voltage sp
              encoding and decoding as per media selection
